## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor to TS Kulis, I want to experience a modern, professional news website that loads quickly, displays beautifully on all devices, and provides reliable access to Trabzonspor news content without technical issues or broken functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I visit the TS Kulis homepage, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a professional, modern design that loads within 3 seconds on both desktop and mobile
2. **Given** I navigate through different news categories, **When** I click on articles, **Then** all images load properly and content displays correctly without layout issues
3. **Given** I am an admin user, **When** I access the content management system, **Then** all editing tools work seamlessly without dependency conflicts
4. **Given** the website is running the latest technology stack, **When** dependencies are updated, **Then** all components continue to function without breaking changes
5. **Given** I browse the site on various devices, **When** I interact with sliders, menus, and forms, **Then** all interactive elements respond correctly and maintain visual consistency

### Edge Cases
- What happens when images fail to load or are missing?
- How does the system handle slow internet connections?
- What occurs when JavaScript is disabled in the browser?
- How does the site perform during high traffic periods?
- What happens when backend services are temporarily unavailable? ‚Üí Display cached content with "limited functionality" banner

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
