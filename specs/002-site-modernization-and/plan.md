# Implementation Plan: Complete Website Modernization & Professional Enhancement

**Branch**: `002-site-modernization-and` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-site-modernization-and/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: Web application with Next.js frontend containing API routes, external .NET backend for news API, and MongoDB for data persistence. The project uses the Next.js file-based routing system with dynamic routes for categories and articles.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations found - all Constitution checks passed*

All modernization approaches align with constitutional principles:
- Modern Stack Maintenance: Latest stable versions planned
- Backward Compatibility: All existing functionality preserved  
- Test-Driven Upgrades: Comprehensive testing strategy defined
- Content Management Integrity: Editorial workflows protected
- Performance-First Architecture: Performance improvements targeted

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - research.md generated
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md generated
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - approach described below)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved (5 clarifications completed)
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)

## Phase 2 Approach: Task Generation Strategy

The `/tasks` command will generate tasks following these principles:

### Task Categories
1. **Setup & Dependencies** (T001-T010): Environment preparation, dependency audits, TypeScript configuration
2. **Framework Upgrades** (T011-T025): Next.js, React, and core package updates with testing
3. **Visual Modernization** (T026-T035): UI/UX improvements, responsive design, accessibility compliance
4. **Performance Optimization** (T036-T045): Image optimization, caching, bundle analysis, Core Web Vitals
5. **Testing & Quality** (T046-T055): Test suite creation, E2E testing, performance monitoring
6. **Content Management** (T056-T065): CKEditor integration, image upload pipeline, admin workflows
7. **Deployment & Validation** (T066-T075): Production deployment, monitoring setup, rollback testing

### Task Sequencing Rules
- Dependencies must be resolved before framework upgrades
- Testing infrastructure must be established before major changes
- Visual changes require performance validation
- Content management testing before production deployment
- Progressive rollout with monitoring at each phase

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- TypeScript configuration alongside dependency updates
- Visual improvements concurrent with performance optimization
- Testing setup parallel with modernization work
- Documentation updates throughout all phases

### Quality Gates
Each task category includes validation checkpoints:
- Automated tests must pass before proceeding
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Constitution compliance verified at each phase
- Rollback procedures tested and documented
