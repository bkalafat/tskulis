```

## Notes & Guidelines

### Task Execution Rules
- **[P] tasks** = Different files, no dependencies - safe for parallel execution
- **Sequential tasks** = Same file modifications or dependent functionality
- **TDD Enforcement**: All tests (T011-T028) must be written and failing before implementation begins
- **Constitution Compliance**: Every task must preserve backward compatibility and content integrity

### Quality Gates
- Each phase requires all tests to pass before proceeding
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained or improved
- Code coverage must reach 60% minimum before deployment
- WCAG 2.1 Level A compliance verified at each visual change

### Rollback Safety
- Each major upgrade (T029-T035) includes rollback testing
- Database migration scripts (T057) include reverse migration capability  
- Feature flags available for gradual rollout of enhancements
- Complete backup verification before any destructive operations

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Homepage <3s load, interactive response <100ms
- **Scalability**: Support 100-500 concurrent users
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level A compliance maintained
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime during upgrade process
- **Quality**: 60% minimum test coverage achieved

This task list provides a comprehensive, dependency-ordered approach to modernizing the TS Kulis website while maintaining operational excellence and constitutional compliance.
